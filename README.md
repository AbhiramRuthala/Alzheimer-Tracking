# INCOMPLETE PROJECT: Tracking neuron levels to find optimal treatments for Alzheimer's Disease
This system simulates the Alzheimer's Disease onto a person. Sample neuron levels are identified and tracked and final results will be plotted on a graph demonstrating changes. It'll be able to classify the hormone levels and say when a treatment would be feasible as well.
